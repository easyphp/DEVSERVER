     [Evgeny Kotkov]

  *) mod_http2: new directive 'H2PushResource' to enable early pushes before 
     processing of the main request starts. Resources are announced to the 
     client in Link headers on a 103 early hint response. 
     All responses with status code <400 are inspected for Link header and
     trigger pushes accordingly. 304 still does prevent pushes.
     'H2PushResource' can mark resources as 'critical' which gives them higher
     priority than the main resource. This leads to preferred scheduling for
     processing and, when content is available, will send it first. 'critical'
     is also recognized on Link headers. [Stefan Eissing]
     
  *) mod_proxy_http2: uris in Link headers are now mapped back to a suitable
     local url when available. Relative uris with an absolute path are mapped
     as well. This makes reverse proxy mapping available for resources
     announced in this header. 
     With 103 interim responses being forwarded to the main client connection,
     this effectively allows early pushing of resources by a reverse proxied
     backend server. [Stefan Eissing]
     
  *) mod_proxy_http2: adding support for newly proposed 103 status code.
     [Stefan Eissing]
     
  *) mpm_unix: Apache fails to start if previously crashed then restarted with
     the same PID (e.g. in container).  PR 60261.

  *) mod_proxy_http2: improved robustness when main connection is closed early
     by resetting all ongoing streams against the backend.

     reading the request body.  [Yann Ylavic]

  *) mod_http2: connection shutdown revisited: corrected edge cases on
     shutting down ongoing streams, changed log warnings to be less noisy
     when waiting on long running tasks. [Stefan Eissing]

  *) mod_http2: changed all AP_DEBUG_ASSERT to ap_assert to have them 
     available also in normal deployments. [Stefan Eissing]

  *) mod_http2/mod_proxy_http2: 100-continue handling now properly implemented
     up to the backend. Reused HTTP/2 proxy connections with more than a second
     not used will block request bodies until a PING answer is received.
     Requests headers are not delayed by this, since they are repeatable in
     case of failure. This greatly increases robustness, especially with
     busy server and/or low keepalive connections. [Stefan Eissing]
     
  *) mod_proxy_http2: fixed duplicate symbols with mod_http2.

     [Jari Urpalainen <jari.urpalainen nokia.com>]

  *) mod_proxy_http2: properly care for HTTP2 flow control of the frontend
     connection is HTTP/1.1. [Patch supplied by Evgeny Kotkov]
     
  *) mod_http2: improved cleanup of connection/streams/tasks to always
     have deterministic order regardless of event initiating it. Addresses
     reported crashes due to memory read after free issues. 
     [Stefan Eissing] 
  
  *) mod_ssl: Correct the interaction between SSLProxyCheckPeerCN and newer
     SSLProxyCheckPeerName directives since release 2.4.5, such that disabling
     either disables both, and that enabling either triggers the new, more
     comprehensive SSLProxyCheckPeerName behavior. Only a single configuration
     remains to enable the legacy behavior, which is to explicitly disable
     SSLProxyCheckPeerName, and enable SSLProxyCheckPeerCN. [William Rowe]

  *) mod_include: add the <!--#comment ...> syntax in order to include comments
     in a SSI file. [Christophe Jaillet based on a suggestion from Rob]

  *) mod_http2: improved event handling for suspended streams, responses

     Requests from the same HTTP/2 frontend connection against the same backend
     are aggregated on a single connection.
     [Stefan Eissing]
  
  *) mod_http2: slave connections have conn_rec->aborted flag set when a stream
     has been reset by the client. [Stefan Eissing]

  *) mod_http2: merge of some 2.4.x adaptions re filters on slave connections.
     Small fixes in bucket beams when forwarding file buckets. Output handling
     on master connection uses less FLUSH and passes automatically when more
     than half of H2StreamMaxMemSize bytes have accumulated.
     Workaround for http: when forwarding partial file buckets to keep the
     output filter from closing these too early. [Stefan Eissing]

  *) mod_http2: elimination of fixed master connection buffer for TLS 
     connections. New scratch bucket handling optimized for TLS write sizes. 
     File bucket data read directly into scratch buffers, avoiding one
     copy. Non-TLS connections continue to pass buckets unchanged to the core
     filters to allow sendfile() usage. [Stefan Eissing]

  *) mod_http2/mod_proxy_http2: h2_request.c is no longer shared between these
     modules. This simplifies building on platforms such as Windows, as module

  *) Scoreboard: Fix a regression in 2.4.20 that causes wrong request data
     to be displayed on the status page. PR 59333. [Yann Ylavic, William Rowe]

  *) mod_http2: fixed a bug that caused mod_proxy_http2 to be called for window
     updates on requests it had already reported done. Added synchronization
     on early connection/stream close that lets ongoing requests safely drain
     their input filters.
     [Stefan Eissing]

  *) mod_http2: scoreboard updates that summarize the h2 session (and replace
     the last request information) will only happen when the session is idle or 
     in shutdown/done phase. [Stefan Eissing]

  *) mod_http2: new "bucket beam" technology to transport buckets across
     threads without buffer copy. Delaying response start until flush or
     enough body data has been accumulated. Overall significantly smaller
     memory footprint. [Stefan Eissing]

  *) core: New CGIVar directive can configure REQUEST_URI to represent the
     current URI being processed instead of always the original request.

  *) mod_http2: fixed apr_uint64_t formatting in a log statement to user proper 
     APR def, thanks to @Sp1l.

  *) mod_http2: number of worker threads allowed to a connection is adjusting 
     dynamically. Starting with 4, the number is doubled when streams can be 
     served without block on http/2 connection flow. The number is halfed, when
     the server has to wait on client flow control grants. 
     This can happen with a maximum frequency of 5 times per second. 
     When a connection occupies too many workers, repeatable requests 
     (GET/HEAD/OPTIONS) are cancelled and placed back in the queue. Should that 
     not suffice and a stream is busy longer than the server timeout, the 
     connection will be aborted with error code ENHANCE_YOUR_CALM.
     This does *not* limit the number of streams a client may open, rather the
     number of server threads a connection might use.

     connection to announce protocol choices. [Stefan Eissing]

  *) mod_http2: reworked deallocation on connection shutdown and worker
     abort. Separate parent pool for all workers. worker threads are joined
     on planned worker shutdown. [Yann Ylavic, Stefan Eissing]

  *) mod_ssl: when receiving requests for other virtual hosts than the handshake
     server, the SSL parameters are checked for equality. With equal 
     configuration, requests are passed for processing. Any change will trigger
     the old behaviour of "421 Misdirected Request".
     SSL now remembers the cipher suite that was used for the last handshake.
     This is compared against for any vhost/directory cipher specification. 
     Detailed examination of renegotiation is only done when these do not
     match.
     Renegotiation is 403ed when a master connection is present. Exact reason
     is given additionally in a request note. [Stefan Eissing]

     delay when reading the next request without flushing.  [Yann Ylavic]

  *) mod_ssl: Extend expression parser registration to support ssl variables
     in any expression using mod_rewrite syntax "%{SSL:VARNAME}" or function
     syntax "ssl(VARNAME)". [Rainer Jung]

  *) mod_authn_socache: change directive name from AuthnCacheProvider
     to AuthnCacheProvideFor.  The term "provider" is overloaded in
     this module, and we should avoid confusion between the provider
     of a backend (AuthnCacheSOCache) and the authn provider(s) for
     which this module provides cacheing (AuthnCacheProvideFor).
     [Nick Kew]

  *) mod_proxy_http: Allocate the fake backend request from a child pool
     of the backend connection, instead of misusing the pool of the frontend
     request. Fixes a thread safety issue where buckets set aside in the
     backend connection leak into other threads, and then disappear when
     the frontend request is cleaned up, in turn causing corrupted buckets
     to make other threads spin. [Graham Leggett]

  *) mod_ssl: Change the format of the SSL_{CLIENT,SERVER}_{I,S}_DN variables

     ap_expr's public interface and provide hooks for modules to add variables

     inodes in addition to size of files. Prevents a cache disk from
     running out of space when many small files are cached.
     [Graham Leggett]

  *) core: Rename MaxRequestsPerChild to MaxConnectionsPerChild, which
     describes more accurately what the directive does. The old name
     still works but logs a warning. [Stefan Fritsch]

  *) mod_cache: Optionally serve stale data when a revalidation returns a
     5xx response, controlled by the CacheStaleOnError directive.
     [Graham Leggett]

     'ssl-verify-client' (for use with 'SSLVerifyClient optional'), and
     'ssl-require' (expressions with same syntax as SSLRequire).
     [Stefan Fritsch]

  *) mod_ssl: Make the ssl expression parser thread-safe. It now requires
     bison instead of yacc. [Stefan Fritsch]

  *) mod_disk_cache: Change on-disk header file format to support the
     link of the device/inode of the data file to the matching header
     file, and to support the option of not writing a data file when
     the data file is empty. [Graham Leggett]

  *) core/mod_unique_id: Add generate_log_id hook to allow to use
     the ID generated by mod_unique_id as error log ID for requests.
     [Stefan Fritsch]

  *) mod_cache: Make sure that we never allow a 304 Not Modified response
     that we asked for to leak to the client should the 304 response be
     uncacheable. PR45341 [Graham Leggett]

  *) mod_cache: Add the cache_status hook to register the final cache
     decision hit/miss/revalidate. Add optional support for an X-Cache
     and/or an X-Cache-Detail header to add the cache status to the
     response. PR48241 [Graham Leggett]

  *) mod_authz_host: Add 'local' provider that matches connections originating
     on the local host. PR 19938. [Stefan Fritsch]

  *) Event MPM: Fix crash accessing pollset on worker thread when child
     process is exiting.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) core: For process invocation (cgi, fcgid, piped loggers and so forth)
     pass the system library path (LD_LIBRARY_PATH or platform-specific
     variables) along with the system PATH, by default.  Both should be
     overridden together as desired using PassEnv etc; see mod_env.
     [William Rowe]

  *) mod_cache: Introduce CacheStoreExpired, to allow administrators to
     capture a stale backend response, perform If-Modified-Since requests
     against the backend, and serving from the cache all 304 responses.
     This restores pre-2.2.4 cache behavior.  [William Rowe]

  *) mod_rewrite: Introduce <=, >= string comparison operators, and integer
     comparators -lt, -le, -eq, -ge, and -gt.  To help bash users and drop
     the ambiguity of the symlink test "-ltest", introduce -h or -L as
     symlink test operators.  [William Rowe]

  *) mod_cache: Give the cache provider the opportunity to choose to cache
     or not cache based on the buckets present in the brigade, such as the
     presence of a FILE bucket.
     [Graham Leggett]

  *) mod_authz_core: Allow authz providers to check args while reading the
     config and allow to cache parsed args. Move 'all' and 'env' authz
     providers from mod_authz_host to mod_authz_core. Add 'method' authz
     provider depending on the HTTP method.  [Stefan Fritsch]

  *) mod_include: Move the request_rec within mod_include to be
     exposed within include_ctx_t. [Graham Leggett]

  *) mod_include: Reinstate support for UTF-8 character sets by allowing a
     variable being echoed or set to be decoded and then encoded as separate
     steps. PR47686 [Graham Leggett]

  *) mod_cache: Add a discrete commit_entity() provider function within the
     mod_cache provider interface which is called to indicate to the
     provider that caching is complete, giving the provider the opportunity
     to commit temporary files permanently to the cache in an atomic
     fashion. Replace the inconsistent use of error cleanups with a formal
     set of pool cleanups attached to a subpool, which is destroyed on error.
     [Graham Leggett]

  *) mod_cache: Change the signature of the store_body() provider function
     within the mod_cache provider interface to support an "in" brigade
     and an "out" brigade instead of just a single input brigade. This
     gives a cache provider the option to consume only part of the brigade
     passed to it, rather than the whole brigade as was required before.
     This fixes an out of memory and a request timeout condition that would
     occur when the original document was a large file. Introduce
     CacheReadSize and CacheReadTime directives to mod_disk_cache to control
     the amount of data to attempt to cache at a time. [Graham Leggett]

  *) core: Add ErrorLogFormat to allow configuring error log format, including
     additional information that is logged once per connection or request. Add
     error log IDs for connections and request to allow correlating error log
     lines and the corresponding access log entry. [Stefan Fritsch]

  *) core: Disable sendfile by default. [Stefan Fritsch]

  *) mod_cache: Check the request to determine whether we are allowed
     to return cached content at all, and respect a "Cache-Control:
     no-cache" header from a client. Previously, "no-cache" would
     behave like "max-age=0". [Graham Leggett]

  *) mod_cache: Use a proper filter context to hold filter data instead
     of misusing the per-request configuration. Fixes a segfault on trunk
     when the normal handler is used. [Graham Leggett]

  *) mod_cgid: Log a warning if the ScriptSock path is truncated because
     it is too long. PR 49388.  [Stefan Fritsch]

  *) core, authn/z: Avoid calling access control hooks for internal requests
     with configurations which match those of initial request.  Revert to
     original behaviour (call access control hooks for internal requests
     with URIs different from initial request) if any access control hooks or
     providers are not registered as permitting this optimization.
     Introduce wrappers for access control hook and provider registration

     'AuthType' and 'AuthName' out of the core module and merge mod_authz_alias
     into mod_authn_core. [Brad Nicholes]

  *) Authz: Move the directives 'Order', 'Allow', 'Deny' and 'Satisfy'
     into the new module mod_access_compat which can be loaded to provide
     support for these directives.
     [Brad Nicholes]

  *) Authz: Move the 'Require' directive from the core module as well as
     add the directives '<SatisfyAll>', '<SatisfyOne>', '<RequireAlias>'
     and 'Reject' to mod_authz_core. The new directives introduce 'AND/OR'
     logic into the authorization processing. [Brad Nicholes]

  *) Authz: Add the new module mod_authz_core which acts as the
     authorization provider vector and contains common authz
     directives. [Brad Nicholes]

  *) Authz: Renamed mod_authz_dbm authz providers from 'group' and
     'file-group' to 'dbm-group' and 'dbm-file-group'. [Brad Nicholes]

  *) Authz: Added the new authz providers 'env', 'ip', 'host', 'all' to handle
     host-based access control provided by mod_authz_host and invoked
     through the 'Require' directive. [Brad Nicholes]

  *) Authz: Convert all of the authz modules from hook based to
     provider based. [Brad Nicholes]

  *) mod_cache: Add CacheMinExpire directive to set the minimum time in
     seconds to cache a document.
     [Brian Akins <brian.akins turner.com>, Ruediger Pluem]

  *) mod_authz_dbd: SQL authz with Login/Session support [Nick Kew]

  *) Fix typo in ProxyStatus syntax error message.
     [Christophe Jaillet <christophe.jaillet wanadoo.fr>]

  *) Asynchronous write completion for the Event MPM.  [Brian Pane]

  *) Added an End-Of-Request bucket type.  The logging of a request and
     the freeing of its pool are now done when the EOR bucket is destroyed.
     This has the effect of delaying the logging until right after the last
     of the response is sent; ap_core_output_filter() calls the access logger
     indirectly when it destroys the EOR bucket.  [Brian Pane]

  *) Rewrite of logresolve support utility: IPv6 addresses are now supported
     and the format of statistical output has changed. [Colm MacCarthaigh]

  *) Rewrite of ap_coreoutput_filter to do nonblocking writes  [Brian Pane]

  *) Added new connection states for handler and write completion
     [Brian Pane]

  *) mod_cgid: Refuse to work on Solaris 10 due to OS bugs.  PR 34264.
     [Justin Erenkrantz]

  *) Teach mod_ssl to use arbitrary OIDs in an SSLRequire directive,
     allowing string-valued client certificate attributes to be used for
     access control, as in: SSLRequire "value" in OID("1.3.6.1.4.1.18060.1")
     [Martin Kraemer, David Reid]
